# LogisticMap

Logistic map functions made for Complex Adaptive Systems class and to better understand logistic map equation and chaos

# Map.py

Creates bifurcation graph

# TimeSeries.py

Creates a time series of logisitc map. Can be manipulated for different values of r to see attractors -> chaos

Currently creates two figures. Figure 1 is a non-chaotic time series, Figure 2 is chaotic

# Data Files

data generated is stored in two files: dataChaotic.txt and dataNonChaotic.txt

# WalkerEq

Implementation of equation used as model in Walker paper to get fig 3. Currently has issues.
