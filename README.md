# LogisticMap

Logistic map functions made for Complex Adaptive Systems class and to better understand logistic map equation and chaos

# Map.py

Creates bifurcation graph

# TimeSeries.py

Creates a time series of logisitc map. Can be manipulated for different values of r to see attractors -> chaos
